Niki Vazou
Developer of Liquid Haskell

My dream is to bring formal verification into everyday programming 
and I pursuit my dream under a post-doc position at University of Maryland.

Haskell is my favorite programming language 
because I find programming with functions the natural way to go 
and also I never figured out how to prevent null pointer, runtime exceptions. 

At UC San Diego, we developed Liquid Haskell that extends Haskell types with logic
with a goal to catch more exceptions before runtime. 
Even though Liquid Haskell uses sophisticated verification techniques, 
they are hidden behind its user-friendly interface. 
In my talk, I aim to persuade you that Liquid HAskell is indeed both usable and useful.
